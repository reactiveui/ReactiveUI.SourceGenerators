/// Each generated file was built in its own fresh builder, so a pass allocated a builder and its grown chunk
/// chain per file and threw them away. Renting from a per-thread free list lets one pass reuse the same
/// buffers, and a builder that has already grown to fit one file starts large enough for the next.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// The free list is a list rather than a single slot because the emitters nest: a grouping key is built while
/// the file it belongs to is still open. A single slot would hand the same builder to both.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Thread-static because source-output callbacks can run concurrently, and because renting must not need a
/// lock to be worth doing. A builder is only reused after <see cref="ToStringAndReturn"/> hands it back, so two
/// live rents never share one.
